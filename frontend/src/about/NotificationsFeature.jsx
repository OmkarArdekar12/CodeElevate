          Notification System
        </h2>
        <p>
          The notification system on CodeElevate keeps users informed of
          important social interactions by sending notifications when someone
          follows or unfollows them, likes their posts, or sends a connection
          request. Notifications appear seamlessly, and users can manage them
          easily â€” by hovering over a notification, a delete button appears,
          allowing users to remove unwanted notifications and keep their
          notification feed organized. This system promotes engagement and
          ensures users never miss key updates within their network.
